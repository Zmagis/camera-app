# Welcome to simple camera app ðŸ‘‹


## Run the project

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

## Choices

* Expo CLI: Today, using Expo is highly recommended by the React Native community. Although I have never worked on a project with Expo before, I decided to give it a try.
* styled-Components: I chose styled-components because it enhances readability and maintainability of the code.

## Key Area for Improvement

Due to time constraints, I couldn't implement all the improvements I had in mind. The primary enhancement I would focus on is optimizing how images are stored and displayed from storage.
